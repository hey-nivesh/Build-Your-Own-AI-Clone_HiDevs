Tech Advisor FAQ
What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language known for its readability and versatility. It's widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, and scientific computing. Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and its extensive library ecosystem makes it suitable for beginners and experts alike.

How do I install Node.js?
You can download Node.js from the official website (nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system. For Windows, download the .msi installer and run it. For macOS, you can use the .pkg installer or install via Homebrew with 'brew install node'. For Linux, you can use your distribution's package manager or download from the official site.

What is a virtual environment?
A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment that allows you to manage dependencies for different projects separately. It prevents conflicts between different versions of packages. You can create one using 'python -m venv myenv' and activate it with 'myenv\Scripts\activate' on Windows or 'source myenv/bin/activate' on macOS/Linux.

What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously and keeps a complete history of all changes. Common Git commands include 'git init', 'git add', 'git commit', 'git push', and 'git pull'.

How do I debug Python code?
There are several ways to debug Python code: 1) Use print statements to output variable values, 2) Use the built-in debugger (pdb) by adding 'import pdb; pdb.set_trace()', 3) Use IDE debugging features in PyCharm, VSCode, or other editors, 4) Use logging instead of print for better control, 5) Write unit tests to catch bugs early.

What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define how software components should interact and are used to enable integration between different systems. REST APIs are commonly used for web services.

How do I handle errors in Python?
Python uses try-except blocks for error handling. You can catch specific exceptions or use a general except clause. Best practices include: catching specific exceptions rather than using bare except, using finally blocks for cleanup code, raising custom exceptions when appropriate, and logging errors for debugging purposes.

What is machine learning?
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence where computers learn to make predictions or decisions by finding patterns in data, without being explicitly programmed for each task. Common types include supervised learning (learning from labeled examples), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error).

How do I optimize Python code performance?
To optimize Python code: 1) Use built-in functions and libraries (they're implemented in C), 2) Avoid unnecessary loops and use list comprehensions, 3) Use appropriate data structures (sets for membership testing, dictionaries for lookups), 4) Profile your code to identify bottlenecks, 5) Consider using NumPy for numerical computations, 6) Use caching for expensive operations.

What is Docker?
Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. Containers ensure that applications run consistently across different environments. Docker helps with deployment, scaling, and managing applications in development, testing, and production environments.

How do I secure a web application?
Web application security involves multiple layers: 1) Use HTTPS for all communications, 2) Implement proper authentication and authorization, 3) Validate and sanitize all user inputs, 4) Protect against SQL injection and XSS attacks, 5) Keep dependencies updated, 6) Implement rate limiting, 7) Use security headers, 8) Regular security audits and penetration testing.

What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing delivers computing services (servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet. Main service models include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Benefits include scalability, cost-effectiveness, accessibility, and reduced maintenance overhead.
